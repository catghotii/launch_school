Flames are bursting in the windows and people are jumping out of the windows as an act of desperation. They perhaps signal the same figures we see chained in the Devil card earlier. They want to escape the turmoil and destruction within. The Tower is a symbol for the ambition that is constructed on faulty premises. The destruction of the tower must happen in order to clear out the old ways and welcome something new. Its revelations can come in a flash of truth or inspiration.",

One foot of the angel is in water, to represent the subconscious, while the other foot is on dry land, a representation of the material world. On her robe, there is a square, which has a triangle inscribed inside, another echo of the tangible earth in union with the holy trinity. She holds two cups in a manner where she can mix the waters, which represent the super and subconscious minds. The water flows between them, suggesting union and infinity.\n\nEverything about this card represents balance, the perfect harmony that comes from the union of dualities.

He is standing on a pedestal, to which are chained a nude man and woman, as if to show that he has dominion over them.\n\nBoth the man and the woman have horns, as if to show that the more time they spend with the Devil, the less human they become. The chains make it appear as though the devil has taken them captive. The man has a flame on his tail while a woman has a bowl of grapes on her tail, which symbolizes their addiction to power and finer things in life, respectively.\n\nLooking closely, both the man and the woman donâ€™t look happy.

Her world is ruled by venus which means that there is complete love, harmony, fertility and luxury by the grace of this goddess. The woman herself has blonde hair crowned with stars, signaling her divine connection with the mystical realm. She is dressed in a pomegranate-patterned robe that represents fertility, and she is seated on cushions embroidered with a venus sign. She is surrounded by an enchanting green forest with a river streaming through it. The Empress brings abundance and blessings in the readings of those she meets.",

In one hand, he carries a scepter, representing his reign and his right to rule, and in the other an orb, a symbol of the kingdom that he watches over. The long beard of the emperor represents his vast experience; over time he has learned much about what it takes to rule, to establish power, authority and complete order for the benefit of his people.\n\nBehind him, the barren mountains shows his determination, his ambition for greater heights and his leadership capability. Contrast this with his complement, the Empress, whose flowing fields are filled with nurturing kindness. The Emperor instead rules with grit, strength and force.",

The couple is seen holding each other in a loving and romantic embrace, while the children are freely playing. The couple seems to be in a stable relationship, while also blessed with the abundance of a comfortable home and beautiful children. The green land signifies fertility, and the river shows how freely the feelings of the couple are flowing, meaning that their relationship is quite peaceful. Above in the sky, there are ten cups, shaped in an arc, which are meant to symbolize blessings from heaven. The rainbow behind them shows the end of hard times and sorrows, and a new happy life where each and every one of the family will enjoy. The Ten of Cups card depicts â€˜having it allâ€™.",

But it doesn't necessarily have to be truly frightening or ominous. Because at the heart of this card, its message is foundational, groundbreaking change.\n\nThe kind of event that the Tower card marks does not have to be something terrible, like a disaster or a great loss.  Change itself is a normal part of life that one has to embrace. But it can sometimes strike fear, for it means that we must abandon the truths that we have known prior to this event. The old ways are no longer useful, and you must find another set of beliefs, values and processes to take their place.\n\nBe positive, it is time for you to replace the old foundations of the past with something that is more genuine and will serve you better in what is to come.\n\nIn terms of work, there is an inevitable argument bound to happen. You need to be in control and keep your temper in check. Avoid saying something that may hurt other people. When it comes to your love life, your romantic relationship may be nearing its end. Take this as a warning - if you really value your relationship, then it is time for you to take damage control or open a communication to clear misunderstandings. In your finances, the tower meaning refers to the need to be assured on your transactions.",

While initially painful, these clear the way for new experiences. Perhaps your relationship was incredibly important to your identity; you took pride in being a good partner or parent, making you stay even while you may have otherwise been unhappy. While these times may be trying, know that they will pass. Should you be single, it may not be a relationship that is being broken down, but your perspective and understanding of the entire notion of what love means to you. What beliefs about love are not serving your highest self? These need to be transformed so you can develop an individual understanding of what your needs are when it comes to relationships.",

Something from the outside environment, like a new boss, or the loss of a colleague could mean disasters happening in the workplace. It is important to remember that at this time, though things are frustrating, that it is possible for these temporary messes to lead to a better long term future, such as a job that suits you better, or a more peaceful workplace in the long term.",

The Tower in its worst case scenario speaks of disaster, and in finances it is no different. There may be unwelcome surprises in store that can create a sudden loss of resources. These scenarios can serve as wake up calls; develop a resilient support system, and tend to the things that truly matter to you."

What you have not realized is that these breakdowns can be beneficial in breaking down your reliance on something that is false. The tower is built on faulty foundations, and it must fall. Though the destruction will be painful, the humbleness resulting from it can bring us peace.\n\nWhat you relied on will no longer be there for you. Do not take this as a drastic and depressing change, it is time for you to become more self-reliant.",

If you see any problems in your relationship looming in the distance, this is your chance to deal with them now. Doing so may prevent bigger problems later. Are your resentments building up? What have you been keeping quiet because you think itâ€™s not worth arguing over? Slowly, these things may turn into big issues that can uproot an otherwise happy relationship. Sometimes, this card can also signal that you may be ready to leave a relationship that has not been working.",

For example, if your workplace has gone through a series of layoffs or redundancies, you may find yourself amongst one of the lucky few that have managed to keep your job. This may come as a relief, or alternatively, can keep you from finding true fulfillment in your career. Sometimes, the Tower is the card that we all need to kick us out of our own stupor, and be motivated to leave the comfort of a monotonous job. This may be the chance you needed to open your eyes to what else could be awaiting you.",
                :finances => "If youâ€™ve managed to successfully navigate yourself out of financial ruin, take the time to find a bit of relief. However, the Tower suggests that it may be better to accept that this needs to happen for you to move on. For example, if youâ€™ve avoided bankruptcy by a hair by managing to pay off your debt for this month, it may be easier and healthier in the long run to accept your situation and declare bankruptcy. Or if youâ€™ve purchased a home you canâ€™t afford, and the mortgage payments are putting you underwater, it may be wiser for you to sell. Otherwise, one disaster is avoided, only to be restarted again next time; you may continue to have to struggle indefinitely. Consider what will ease your burden right now, and face the situation with a brave face."

The Temperance tarot card suggests moderation and balance, coupled with a lot of patience. Where this card appears, there is the suggestion that extremity in any situation is to be avoided.\n\nThe Temperance card implies that you have a clear vision and know what you want to achieve. This is an indication of higher learning, which is a critical attribute in the journey of life. It reflects that you have found peace with what you are doing and everything is unfolding as it ought to. The Temperance card, in relation to other people, shows that you are able to adapt and work in harmony with your community, your coworkers and your loved ones. Your calmness in all matters gives them comfort and puts them at ease.\n\nTemperance may also indicate a time to evaluate and re-examine the priorities you have chosen.

Are you too giving? Or are you not giving enough? How can you bring these traits into balance? In addition, your relationship or potential relationships may require some patience right now, and attempt to work together to find compromise and harmony.",

Your dedication and ability to navigate emotionally charged situations at work with calm can help you be noticed by your peers and superiors. When it comes to making changes in your career path, the Temperance card can be a reminder to remain patient, steady and devoted; all good things take time. Temperance can also signal doing a good job in balancing your career with different aspects of your life; it is neither an all consuming ambition or just a paycheck to you.",

A Temperance in reversal may also be used as a warning;  if you take a certain path, it would lead to turbulence and excess.\n\nLack of a long-term plan or vision may also be the Temperance reversal meaning. This creates a lack of purpose for you, leaving you feeling lopsided as you search here and there for what you should be doing. You must reflect and think carefully about what needs to change.

You may benefit from being a bit more patient, while also making sure that your own emotions or desires do not go into extremes. When your date does something that is displeasing to you, do you tend to immediately reject them? Are you too demanding on your potential partners, so that nobody ever can satisfy you? Itâ€™s important to remember that humans can never be perfect; make sure your desires are reasonable.",

Or alternatively, do you find that you slack off, leading to resentment from your colleagues? While the former can bring you success, this can be damaging to you in the long term. If this applies to you, look to correct this imbalance. Ensure that when completing projects, you arenâ€™t rushing through them or making reckless choices; the quality of your work may be suffering.",

So, one has to be prepared to make the necessary changes that might initially seem painful to make the adjustments that will pay off in the end by being able to find your true self again.\n\nSelf-assessment is called for in this case and the individual needs to take some time and list all of the things that they need to get rid of. And once that has been done, and then it would be time for them to embark on the difficult journey of self-improvement.",

Where the Empress's desire for their kingdom is to create happiness, the emperor desires to foster honor and discipline. He guides with a firm hand, following the calling of the crown above all else. Though he is a ruler, he understands that to reign is also to serve - thus he acts rationally and according to what is for the greater good of the kingdom.\n\nTo see him in a reading presents a chance to grow in terms of the goals that you have set for yourself. It presents a successful future as long as you pursue your goals similar to the fashion that the Emperor does, methodically, and strategically.\n\nWhen you see him in a reading, a possible interpretation is that you could be put in charge of something important. It could be a position at work or in any kind of organization or institution that desperately needs order and a clear decisive mind.

It could also be that you are playing the part of a weak ruler, hatching a plan to avoid the tasks that come with having responsibility. Perhaps you aspire for a career that is more flexible than one that is governed by strict rules.\n\nLack of self-control and inability to handle situations can be represented by the Emperor on a personal level. When he is reversed, the structures, rules and systems that he creates are no longer working. His desire to inspire higher principles in his kingdom have turned to ruthlessness, tyranny and rigidity. He seeks to dominate, forgetting his call from the crown to do what is best for his people, fearing only for his loss of control and thus creating suffering.",
