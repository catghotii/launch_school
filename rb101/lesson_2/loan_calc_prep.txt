determines monthly payment assuming the interest is compounded monthly

3 pieces of information:
- the loan amount
- the annual percentage rate (APR)
- the loan duration

need to calculate:
- monthly interest rate (APR / 12)
- loan duration in months

use the following formula:
m = p * (j / (1 - (1 + j)**(-n)))

m = monthly payment
p = loan amount
j = monthly interest rate
n = loan duration in months

user input:
loan amount
loan duration

my actions:
1. write pseudocode
2. flowchart
3. write an program!



# PSEUDO-CODE

# casual

Ask user for loan amount
Get user input - SET as loan_amount

Ask user for APR
Get user input - SET as APR

Ask user for loan duration
Get user input - SET as loan_duration

# formal

GET user input - SET loan_amount
GET user input - SET APR
