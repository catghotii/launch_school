## Object Mutability/Mutating Methods

[Hereâ€™s the article](https://launchschool.com/blog/mutating-and-non-mutating-methods) with some of the below examples

### Example 1

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
def fix(value)
  value.upcase!
  value.concat('!')
  value
end

s = 'hello'
t = fix(s)
```

What values do `s` and `t` have? Why?

### Example 2

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
def fix(value)
  value = value.upcase
  value.concat('!')
end

s = 'hello'
t = fix(s)
```

What values do `s` and `t` have? Why?

### Example 3

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
def fix(value)
  value << 'xyz'
  value = value.upcase
  value.concat('!')
end

s = 'hello'
t = fix(s)
```

What values do `s` and `t` have? Why?

### Example 4

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
def fix(value)
  value = value.upcase!
  value.concat('!')
end

s = 'hello'
t = fix(s)
```

What values do `s` and `t` have? Why?

### Example 5

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
def fix(value)
  value[1] = 'x'
  value
end

s = 'abc'
t = fix(s)
```

What values do `s` and `t` have? Why?

### Example 6

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
def a_method(string)
  string << ' world'
end

a = 'hello'
a_method(a)

p a
```

### Example 7

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
arr #?
num = 3
num = 2 * num
```

### Example 8

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
a = %w(a b c)
a[1] = '-'

p a
```

### Example 9

[Link to page with #9 & #10](https://launchschool.com/lessons/a0f3cd44/assignments/4b1ad598)

```ruby
def add_name(arr, name)
  arr = arr + [name]
end

names = ['bob', 'kim']
add_name(names, 'jim')
puts names
```

### Example 10

```ruby
def add_name(arr, name)
  arr = arr << name
end

names = ['bob', 'kim']
add_name(names, 'jim')
puts names
```
