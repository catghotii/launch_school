## Local Variable Scope

### Example 1

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
a = “Hello”
b = a
a = “Goodbye”

puts a
puts b
```

On line 1, `a` is initialised with a reference to the string object `"Hello"`. On line 2, in the assignment of one variable to another, the variable on the left, `b`, receives a copy of the reference stored in the variable on the right, `a`. Both variables point to the same string `"Hello"`.

On line 3, `a` is reassigned with a reference to a new string object `"Goodbye"`. In reassignments, new objects are created, which means that the variable being reassigned is given a different reference—in other words, the variable points to a different address space in memory containing a new object. `b` still points to address space containing the original string `"Hello"`.

The `puts a` and `puts b` method calls will output the strings that each variable is a reference to. The `puts` method returns `nil`, so the last expression evaluated (`puts b`) returns `nil`.

The output is:

```
Goodbye
Hello
```

This code demonstrates:
- how reassignments create new objects and change what a variable references, without affecting other variables that reference the original object
- variables as pointers: they do not contain objects themselves but rather references to objects held in address spaces in memory

puts b
```

### Example 3

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

    i -= 1    
    break if i == 0  
  end
end

example('hello')
```

### Example 5
