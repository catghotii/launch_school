# Write a method that returns true if the string passed as an argument is a palindrome, false otherwise. A palindrome reads the same forward and backward. For this exercise, case matters as does punctuation and spaces.

def palindrome?(string)
  string == string.reverse
end

# p palindrome?('madam') == true
# p palindrome?('Madam') == false          # (case matters)
# p palindrome?("madam i'm adam") == false # (all characters matter)
# p palindrome?('356653') == true

# Write another method that returns true if the string passed as an argument is a palindrome, false otherwise. This time, however, your method should be case-insensitive, and it should ignore all non-alphanumeric characters. If you wish, you may simplify things by calling the palindrome? method you wrote in the previous exercise.

def real_palindrome?(string)
  # case insensitive
  # ignore all non-alphanumeric characters

  new_string = string.downcase.gsub(/[,' ]/, "")
  palindrome?(new_string)
end

p real_palindrome?('madam') == true
p real_palindrome?('Madam') == true           # (case does not matter)
p real_palindrome?("Madam, I'm Adam") == true # (only alphanumerics matter)
p real_palindrome?('356653') == true
p real_palindrome?('356a653') == true
p real_palindrome?('123ab321') == false
