# Question 1

What would you expect the code below to print out?

```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3]
numbers.uniq

puts numbers
```

# Question 2

Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

```
what is != and where should you use it?
put ! before something, like !user_name
put ! after something, like words.uniq!
put ? before something
put ? after something
put !! before something, like !!user_name
```

# Question 3

```
# Replace the word "important" with "urgent" in this string:

advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur."
```

# Question 4

The Ruby Array class has several methods for removing items from the array. Two of them have very similar names. Let's see how they differ:

`numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

What do the following method calls do (assume we reset numbers to the original array between method calls)?

```
numbers.delete_at(1)
numbers.delete(1)
```

# Question 5

```
# Programmatically determine if 42 lies between 10 and 100.

# hint: Use Ruby's range object in your solution.
```

# Question 6

```
# Starting with the string:

famous_words = "seven years ago..."

# show two different ways to put the expected "Four score and " in front of it.
```

# Question 7

```
# If we build an array like this:

flintstones = ["Fred", "Wilma"]
flintstones << ["Barney", "Betty"]
flintstones << ["BamBam", "Pebbles"]

# We will end up with this "nested" array:

["Fred", "Wilma", ["Barney", "Betty"], ["BamBam", "Pebbles"]]

# Make this into an un-nested array.
```

# Question 8

```
# Given the hash below

flintstones = { "Fred" => 0, "Wilma" => 1, "Barney" => 2, "Betty" => 3, "BamBam" => 4, "Pebbles" => 5 }

# Create an array containing only two elements: Barney's name and Barney's number.
```
