# Question 1

```ruby
# In this hash of people and their age,

ages = { "Herman" => 32, "Lily" => 30, "Grandpa" => 402, "Eddie" => 10 }

# see if "Spot" is present.

# Bonus: What are two other hash methods that would work just as well for this solution?
```

# Question 2

```ruby
# Starting with this string:

munsters_description = "The Munsters are creepy in a good way."

# Convert the string in the following ways (code will be executed on original munsters_description above):

# "tHE mUNSTERS ARE CREEPY IN A GOOD WAY."

# "The munsters are creepy in a good way."

# "the munsters are creepy in a good way."

# "THE MUNSTERS ARE CREEPY IN A GOOD WAY."
```

# Question 3

```ruby
# We have most of the Munster family in our age hash:

ages = { "Herman" => 32, "Lily" => 30, "Grandpa" => 5843, "Eddie" => 10 }

# add ages for Marilyn and Spot to the existing hash
```

# Question 4

```ruby
# See if the name "dino" appears in the string below:

advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur."

# Note that this is not a perfect solution, as it would match any substring with Dino in it.
```

# Question 5

```ruby
# Show an easier way to write this array:

flintstones = ["Fred", "Barney", "Wilma", "Betty", "BamBam", "Pebbles"]
```

# Question 6

```ruby
# How can we add the family pet "Dino" to our usual array:

flintstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)
```

# Question 7

```ruby
# In the previous practice problem we added Dino to our array like this:

flintstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)
# flintstones << "Dino"

# We could have used either Array#concat or Array#push to add Dino to the family.

# How can we add multiple items to our array? (Dino and Hoppy)
```

# Question 8

```ruby
# Shorten the following sentence:

advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur."

# Review the String#slice! documentation, and use that method to make the return value "Few things in life are as important as ". But leave the advice variable as "house training your pet dinosaur.".
```

# Question 9

```ruby
# Write a one-liner to count the number of lower-case 't' characters in the following string:

statement = "The Flintstones Rock!"
```

# Question 10

```ruby
# Back in the stone age (before CSS) we used spaces to align things on the screen. If we had a table of Flintstone family members that was forty characters in width, how could we easily center that title above the table with spaces?

title = "Flintstone Family Members"
