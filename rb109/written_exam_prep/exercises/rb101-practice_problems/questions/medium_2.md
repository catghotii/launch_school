# Question 1

```ruby
# Every object in Ruby has access to a method called object_id, which returns a numerical value that uniquely identifies the object. This method can be used to determine whether two variables are pointing to the same object.

# Take a look at the following code and predict the output:

a = "forty two"
b = "forty two"
c = a

puts a.object_id
puts b.object_id
puts c.object_id
```

# Question 2

```ruby
# Let's take a look at another example with a small difference in the code:

a = 42
b = 42
c = a

puts a.object_id
puts b.object_id
puts c.object_id
```

# Question 3

```ruby
# Let's call a method, pass two strings as arguments and see how they can be treated differently depending on the method invoked on them inside the method definition.

# Study the following code and state what will be displayed...and why:

def tricky_method(string_param_one, string_param_two)
  string_param_one += "rutabaga"
  string_param_two << "rutabaga"
end

string_arg_one = "pumpkins"
string_arg_two = "pumpkins"
tricky_method(string_arg_one, string_arg_two)

puts "String_arg_one looks like this now: #{string_arg_one}"
puts "String_arg_two looks like this now: #{string_arg_two}"
```

# Question 4

```ruby
# To drive that last one home...let's turn the tables and have the string show a modified output, while the array thwarts the method's efforts to modify the user's version of it.

def tricky_method_two(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param << 'rutabaga'
  an_array_param = ['pumpkins', 'rutabaga']
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method_two(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
```

# Question 5

```ruby
# Depending on a method to modify its arguments can be tricky:

# def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
#   a_string_param += "rutabaga"
#   an_array_param << "rutabaga"
# end

# my_string = "pumpkins"
# my_array = ["pumpkins"]
# tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

# puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
# puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"

# Whether the above "coincidentally" does what we think we wanted depends upon what is going on inside the method.

# How can we change this code to make the result easier to predict and easier for the next programmer to maintain? That is, the resulting method should not mutate either argument, but my_string should be set to 'pumpkinsrutabaga' and my_array should be set to ['pumpkins', 'rutabaga']
```

# Question 6

```ruby
# How could the following method be simplified without changing its return value?

def color_valid(color)
  if color == "blue" || color == "green"
    true
  else
    false
  end
end
```
