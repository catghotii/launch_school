# Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner? (Part 1)

What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

```ruby
def meal
  return 'Breakfast'
end

puts meal
```

The `puts` method will output the return value of the `meal` method invocation. Inside the method definition, the string `"Breakfast"` is explicitly returned by the `return` keyword—this string is the method's return value, which is the evaluated result of the last expression in the method.

Output:

```
Breakfast
```

# Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner? (Part 2)

What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

```ruby
def meal
  'Evening'
end

puts meal
```

The `puts` method will output the return value of the `meal` method invocation. Inside the method definition, the string `"Evening"` is implicitly returned because the return value of the method is the result of the last evaluated expression—in this case, the evaluated of the string is the last and only expression in the method body, so the method returns this string value `"Evening"`. (The return value of the entire code snippet is `nil`, which is the evaluated result of the last expression in the code, `puts meal`.)

Output:

```
Evening
```

# Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner? (Part 3)

What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

```ruby
def meal
  return 'Breakfast'
  'Dinner'
end

puts meal
```

# Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner? (Part 4)

What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

```ruby
def meal
  puts 'Dinner'
  return 'Breakfast'
end

puts meal
```

The `puts meal` method invocation outputs the return value of the `meal` method invocation. Inside the method definition, `puts 'Dinner'` outputs `'Dinner'`, and then the string `'Breakfast'` is explicitly returned by the `return` keyword—this is the method's return value. If the `return` keyword was not used and only the string `Breakfast` was evaluated, the method would still return this string because the return value of a method is the result of the last evaluated expression, unless an explicit `return` is used prior to the last line. The return value is passed back to the calling code—`puts meal` outputs `'Breakfast'`.

Output:

```
Dinner
Breakfast
```

# Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner? (Part 5)

What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

```ruby
def meal
  'Dinner'
  puts 'Dinner'
end

p meal
```

The `p meal` method outputs the return value of the `meal` method invocation. Inside the method definition, the string `'Dinner'` is evaluated (the value is evaluated to itself), and then the following line `puts 'Dinner'` is evaluated: this expression outputs `'Dinner'` and evaluates to `nil` because `puts` returns `nil`. Since this expression is also the last expression in the method, its evaluated result, `nil`, is also the return value of the method. The return value is passed back to the calling code, `p meal`—therefore `p` outputs `nil` to the console. (`p` prints a "raw" representation of objects; it makes `nil` visible if printed, unlike `puts nil` which would only print a newline.)

Output:

```
Dinner
nil
```

# Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner? (Part 6)

What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

```ruby
def meal
  return 'Breakfast'
  'Dinner'
  puts 'Dinner'
end

puts meal
```

# Counting Sheep (Part 1)

```ruby
def count_sheep
  5.times do |sheep|
    puts sheep
  end
end

puts count_sheep
```

# Counting Sheep (Part 2)

What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

```ruby
def count_sheep
  5.times do |sheep|
    puts sheep
  end
  10
end

puts count_sheep
```

# Counting Sheep (Part 3)

What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

```ruby
def count_sheep
  5.times do |sheep|
    puts sheep
    if sheep >= 2
      return
    end
  end
end

p count_sheep
```

# Tricky Number

```ruby

    number = 1

    2
