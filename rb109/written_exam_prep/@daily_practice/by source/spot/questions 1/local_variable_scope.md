## Local Variable Scope

### Example 1-20250423

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
a = “Hello”
b = a
a = “Goodbye”

puts a
puts b
```

The variable `a` is initialised with a reference to the string object `"Hello"`. In the assignment of one variable to another, `b` receives a copy of the reference stored in `a`, with the result that both variables contain references to the same string object `"Hello"`.

`a` undergoes reassignment, which creates a new string object `"Goodbye"` (rather than modifying the original object) and changes what `a` references. The reference to the original object `"Hello"` is disconnected from the variable `a`, which has no effect on the original object or its references. `b` continues to point to `"Hello"`.

`puts a` and `puts b` output different their respective string values.

```

# Original state
a --> "Hello" <-- b

# After reassignment
a --> "Goodbye"
b --> "Hello"

# Output
Goodbye
Hello
```
