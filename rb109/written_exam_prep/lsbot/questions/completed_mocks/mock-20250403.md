RB109 Written Assessment Practice Questions

Based on your current progress in the Ruby track and preparing for RB109, here are some practice questions that will help you prepare for the written assessment. These questions focus on topics covered in RB101 and the Introduction to Programming with Ruby book.

### 1.  ​Basic​: 

What is the difference between puts and return in Ruby? Provide an example that demonstrates this difference.

### 2.  ​Intermediate​:

Examine the following code and explain what happens on each line and the return value of the example method:

```
# ruby

   def example(str)
     i = 3
     loop do
       str = str.upcase
       i -= 1
       break if i == 0
     end
     str + "!"
   end
   
   result = example("hello")
   puts result
```

### 3.  ​Intermediate​:

What does the following code output? Explain why:

```
# ruby

   arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   new_arr = arr.map do |num|
     if num > 3
       puts num
     else
       num * 2
     end
   end
   
   p new_arr
```
 
### 4.  ​Advanced​:

Explain what the concept of "variable scope" means in Ruby. Illustrate your explanation with examples of local variable scope within methods, blocks, and conditionals.
