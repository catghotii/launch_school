### Question 1 (Basic)

What will the following code output and why? Be specific about the return value versus the output.

```
# ruby  
  
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
new_arr = arr.select do |num|  
  puts num if num.odd?  
end  
p new_arr  
```

### Question 2 (Intermediate)

Explain what happens in the following code, including discussion of variable scoping rules and method return values.

```
# ruby  
  
def greeting(name)  
  puts "Hello, #{name}!"  
  name = name.upcase  
  "Hi, #{name}"  
end  
  
name = "Bob"  
return_value = greeting(name)  
puts name  
puts return_value  
```

### Question 3 (Intermediate)

What will the following code output and why? Pay special attention to the concepts of object mutability and pass-by-reference/pass-by-value.

```
# ruby  
  
def fix(value)  
  value.upcase!  
  value.concat('!')  
  value  
end  
  
s = 'hello'  
t = fix(s)  
  
puts s  
puts t  
puts s.object_id == t.object_id  
```

### Question 4 (Advanced)

What will the following code output and why? Focus on variable shadowing, method definitions, and block execution.

```
# ruby  
  
a = 7  
array = [1, 2, 3]  
  
array.each do |a|  
  a += 1  
  puts a  
end  
  
puts a
```
