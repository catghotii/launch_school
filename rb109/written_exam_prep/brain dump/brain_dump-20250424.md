`puts a if defined?(a)` combines a conditional expression with the `defined?` operator to safely check if a variable exists before trying to use it.Let's break it down:1.  `defined?(a)` is a special operator in Ruby that checks if the variable `a` is defined in the current scope. It returns `nil` if the variable doesn't exist or a string indicating the type of the object if it does exist.2.  The `if` statement uses the truthiness of the `defined?(a)` expression to determine whether to execute the `puts a` statement. In Ruby, `nil` is considered falsy, while any string would be truthy.3.  So this code says: "Only try to output the value of `a` if the variable `a` is actually defined in this scope."This is a safety mechanism to prevent a `NameError` from occurring. Without this check, if you tried to use a variable that wasn't defined, Ruby would raise an error and terminate program execution.For example, in the exercise (Question 4), this code is checking if the local variable `a` that was defined inside the block is accessible in the outer scope. The result will depend on how variable scoping works with blocks in Ruby, which is different from method definitions.This technique is particularly useful when you're not sure if a variable has been defined, such as when dealing with different scopes or conditionally defined variables.
