### assignment of mutated return value

```ruby
def fix(value)
  value = value.upcase!
  value.concat('!')
end

s = 'hello'
t = fix(s)
```

I'd be happy to explain what's happening on the line `value = value.upcase!` in this code.

In this line, there are two important things happening:

1.  First, `value.upcase!` is called. The `upcase!` method is a destructive method (indicated by the `!` at the end) that mutates the string by converting all lowercase letters to uppercase. Unlike the non-destructive `upcase` method which returns a new string with the changes, `upcase!` modifies the original string object that `value` points to. This means that after `value.upcase!`, our string `s` (which `value` initially references) is now "HELLO" instead of "hello".

2.  Second, the return value of `upcase!` is assigned back to the variable `value`. The `upcase!` method returns the mutated string if changes were made, or `nil` if no changes were needed. In this case, since changes were made (lowercase to uppercase), it returns the mutated string "HELLO", which is then assigned back to the `value` variable.This assignment is actually redundant in this case because `value` already points to the same string object that was just mutated by `upcase!`. The assignment doesn't change what `value` refers to - it's still the same string object, just with uppercase letters now.After this line executes, `value` references the uppercase string "HELLO", and since `s` references the same string object (strings are mutable in Ruby), `s` has also been changed to "HELLO".
