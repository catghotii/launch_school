`map` - 

This code demonstrates the transformation aspect of the `map` method. As explained in the [Working with Blocks](https://launchschool.com/lessons/fa1f5e7e/assignments/084fe222) assignment, `map` always performs transformation based on the return value of the block.

Unlike `each`, which simply returns the original collection regardless of what happens in the block, `map` creates a new collection where each element corresponds to the return value of the block for that iteration.
